to initilaize npm before the installation, it is important to run npm init -y command 

npm i --save-dev webpack@latest webpack-dev-server@latest
webpack-dev-server created an HTTP client to serve our files


it is also necessary to start with creating an index.html webpack.config.js and index.js

each webfile has at least one .html file where the browser entry point is. 

You also must have webpack globally on your computer. In order to do this, run
npm i -g webpack@latest
with g meaning global and the @latest downloads the latest version
